Graph:
The graph is one non-linear data structure. That is consists of some nodes and their connected edges. 
The edges may be director or undirected. This graph can be represented as G(V, E). 
The following graph can be represented as G({A, B, C, D, E}, {(A, B), (B, D), (D, E), (B, C), (C, A)})

Types of graph:

1-Breadth First Search (BFS)
The Breadth First Search (BFS) traversal is an algorithm, which is used to visit all of the nodes of a given graph.
In this traversal algorithm one node is selected and then all of the adjacent nodes are visited one by one. 
After completing all of the adjacent vertices, it moves further to check another vertices and checks its adjacent vertices again.

BFS Algorithm Applications:
1-To build index by search index
2-For GPS navigation
3-Path finding algorithms
4-In Ford-Fulkerson algorithm to find maximum flow in a network
5-Cycle detection in an undirected graph
6-In minimum spanning tree


2-Depth First Search (DFS)
The Depth First Search (DFS) is a graph traversal algorithm. In this algorithm one starting vertex is given,
and when an adjacent vertex is found, it moves to that adjacent vertex first and try to traverse in the same manner.

Application of DFS Algorithm:
1-For finding the path
2-To test if the graph is bipartite
3-For finding the strongly connected components of a graph
4-For detecting cycles in a graph
